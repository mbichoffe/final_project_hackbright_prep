''' Where in the World is Lauren Sandi Eggo (Hackbright Prep final project from Marina Bichoffe)
The goal of this game is to track around the world and arrest a villain from E.V.I.L., a criminal organization led by Lauren Sandi Eggo. 
The player, a special agent from the ACME Detective Agency, is alerted that a stupefying theft has been committed. She will receive a brief with information about the case and a deadline. She has the mission to find and arrest the criminal. In order to make an arrest the player must have a warrant, and it must be the right warrant.

The player will be transported to the scene of the crime, where she will complete tasks in order to find clues to infer the suspect's next destination and to create an arrest warrant describing the guilty party's attributes. The chase around the world continues until the player has collected enough evidence to determine the culprit. When the player reaches her final destination where the villain is going to pass off the loot to Lauren, she has to arrest the villain."""

Carmen Santiago and her Evil International League of Villains (E.V.I.L).

to stockpile the world's most valuable treasures, while outwitting every so-called 
"crime expert" from New York to Sydney.  Now they've struck again.  And you, the 
newest employee of the Acme Detective Agency, have been given the near-impossible 
assignment of tracking them down.'''
